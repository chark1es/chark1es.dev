In this project, I am creating a website to present crucial details about GDPT Anoma. I volunteered for this task to ensure easy access to up-to-date information and enhance its accessibility for everyone. The website serves as a platform to showcase photos and share knowledge. Initially written in Hugo, there are plans to migrate it to AstroJS for improved compatibility. Migrating from Hugo to AstroJS will not only streamline compatibility but also provide greater flexibility in terms of design and customization options.
