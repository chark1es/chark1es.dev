For this project, I created a website showcasing my skills, proficiency, and personal information. Additionally, I write occasional blogs on various subjects, including programming and general topics of interest. The website was constructed using AstroJS and draws inspiration from diverse website design styles. It was an enjoyable endeavor through which I acquired extensive knowledge about Astro and became more proficient with the framework.
