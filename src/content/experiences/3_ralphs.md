As an employee of Ralphs, I have responsibility within the eCommerce department. I am responsible for picking the items, putting them in climate control, and delivering their order to their car for customers who order online (for pickup). I make sure the customers have a great experience in picking up their orders and to make sure their order is reviewed for accuracy.
