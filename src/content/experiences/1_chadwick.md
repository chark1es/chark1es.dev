As a Digital Film Instructor at Chadwick, I instructed students in extensive filming and editing techniques. In this position, I adapted my teaching style to meet the individual learning requirements of each student, ensuring that they fully comprehended fundamental concepts such as perspective and transitions. Concurrently, I adopted responsibility for monitoring the health and safety of students during filming sessions, adhering to established health protocols to ensure the safety and security of all participants. In addition, I taught students invaluable Adobe Premiere Pro skills, enabling them to liberate their creativity and master the art of constructing captivating edits that brought their cinematic visions to life.
