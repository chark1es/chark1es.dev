As a camp counselor, my main job is to look after the students and make sure they're safe. I also help out with organizing different events and ensuring that the students get to their classes on time. As part of my role, I assist the instructors as a teacher assistant whenever they need it.
I was also given the opportunity to be a substitute teacher for an introductory coding class and an algebra class. When I filled in, I taught the coding class the basics using Scratch, and for the algebra class, I covered formulas and concepts using Desmos.
